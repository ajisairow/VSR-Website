        <h2>1. Security</h2>
        <h3>Systems must be able to protect against unauthorized access and defend against malicious attacks</h3>
        <p>Computer security actually goes back to the military and intelligence origins of computing. Early computing handled classified information, and the original internet was based off of ARPANET. Ever since the TCP/IP protocol was created for computer networks, attacks became inevitable.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Computers store billions of personal information all over the world. They also handle financial transactions and control crucial infrastructure. A data breach can compromise privacy, threaten national security, and enable crime.</p>
        <p><strong>Ramifications:</strong> The Equifax data breach exposed 147 million personal data!</p>

        <h2>2. Maintainability</h2>
        <h3>Code should be readable, modifiable, and understandable</h3>
        <p>Like older cars and other mechanical machines, code must be maintainable for decades of longevity. With team-based development and the inevitability of change, code must be understandable for future developers, including your future self.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Hardware and technology is constantly changing every second. Software must be able to adapt to those changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Ramifications:</strong> Back in the 1960's, memory and mass storage was expensive and data was input using punched cards in the 1970's. Most programmers didn't think that their programs would be in use for decades, so the Y2K issue sat unnoticed until the last few years of the decades. This caused massive panic and public outrage before December 31, 1999.</p>

        <h2>3. Performance/Efficiency</h2>
        <h3>Systems should use computational resources effectively</h3>
        <p>Performance values derive from historical scarcity—early computers were expensive and slow. Physics constraints like speed of light and heat dissipation, combined with economic pressures and user experience expectations, make efficiency critical.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Poor performance wastes resources, increases costs, and degrades user experience. The difference between efficient and inefficient algorithms determines whether a problem is practically solvable at scale.</p>
        <p><strong>Ramifications:</strong> Healthcare.gov launch failures prevented millions from accessing health insurance. Poor performance leads to wasted billions in infrastructure costs, user abandonment, inability to scale, and significant environmental impact from wasted energy.</p>

        <h2>4. Correctness</h2>
        <h3>Programs must produce accurate, reliable results</h3>
        <p>Correctness derives from mathematics and logic, where computing inherits the requirement for logical consistency from its mathematical foundations. Like bridges that must not collapse, software must perform as designed.</p>
        <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without correctness, computing serves no purpose. A calculator that gives wrong answers or medical software that miscalculates drug dosages is worse than useless—it's dangerous.</p>
        <p><strong>Ramifications:</strong> The Therac-25 radiation therapy machine software bugs led to massive overdoses, killing patients.</p>
